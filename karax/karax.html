                        effects can be improved further with a new mastery.</p>
                     <p>As this is a cooperative mode, Karax's allies will also benefit from these changes – be it their

                     changes in-game. The list will change based on further testing and feedback. Also, few bugs

                     <li class="unit">Mirage</li>
                     <li>Damage increased against non-light targets: 5 (+7 vs light) → 12</li>
                     <li>Phasing armor duration increased: 2s → 3s (cooldown is 5s).</li>
                     <li>Phasing armor reduces incoming damage to zero instead of making the unit invulnerable.</li>
                     <li class="unit">Immortal</li>
                     <li>Shadow Cannon is available without the upgrade.</li>
                     <li>Shadow Cannon upgrade is renamed to <span class="imp">Improved Shadow Cannon</span> which lets
                        Immortals store one additional charge on the ability.</li>
                     <li class="unit">Colossus</li>
                     <li>Incendiary Lance no longer increases attack period from 1.65 to 2.2 (possible bug).</li>
                     <li>Incendiary Lance damage over 5s increased: 150 → 250</li>
                     <li class="unit">Carrier</li>
                     <li>Carriers start with 1 Repair Drone without any upgrade</li>
                     <li>Repair Drones upgrade renamed to <span class="imp">Carrier Capacity</span></li>
                     <ul>
                        <li>Upgrade cost reduced: 200/200 → 100/100</li>
                        <li>Increases Interceptors per Carrier: 8 → 10</li>
                        <li>Increases Repair Drones per Carrier: 1 → 3</li>
                     </ul>
                     <li>Carrier no longer has to stop for Repair Drones to start repairing mechanical units.</li>
                     <li class="commentary">Better and more numerous Repair Drones should make Carriers more attractive
                        to add to the army for bonus repair. Increased Interceptor numbers help to justify increased
                        Carrier cost. Reduced upgrade cost encourages mixing unit compositions.</li>
                     <li>New ability <span class="imp">Power Discharge</span> – Carrier releases its energy disabling
                        enemy units in wide radius. Enemy heroic units can still attack and move but at reduced speed.
                     </li>
                     <li class="commentary">Power Discharge provides an opportunity for micro and decision making with
                        Carriers. It can be particularly useful when combined with ground army. It can also serve as an
                        alternative form of detection.</li>
                     <li class="unit">Pylon</li>
                     <li>Power source range increased: 6.5 → 8</li>
                     <li class="commentary">This is mainly a quality of life change to make phasing easier. One forward
                        Pylon will be enough for a good amount of phased cannons.</li>
                     <li class="unit">Photon Cannon, Shield Battery, Khaydarin Monolith</li>
                     <li>These structures can phase every 30s to a new location in 30 distance. This ability requires
                        powerfield at the targeted location.</li>
                     <li>Attack and armor upgrades affect structures as well. Highest value is counted between air and
                        ground upgrades.</li>
                     <li class="unit">Enhanced Targeting</li>
                     <li>Defensive Structures can phase in unlimtied distance in addition to granting +2 range to
                        weapons and abilities of static defense.</li>
                     <li class="commentary">This significantly helps with phasing, and it being an upgrade provides an
                        interesting choice when or if to get it. On the other side, having direct combat benefit
                        prevents players from trying to optimize too hard.</li>
                     <li class="unit">Shadow Cannon</li>
                     <li>Upgrade cost reduced: 150/150 → 100/100</li>
                     <li class="commentary">The cost is now consistent with other upgrades on Robotic Facility, and the
                        barrier between fun abilities and players is reduced.</li>
                     <li class="unit">Twilight Council</li>
                     <li>All upgrade costs set to 100/100 (3 of them previously at 150/150).</li>
                     <li class="commentary">This is to further reduce the tech cost of Karax, encourage mixing unit
                        compositions or switching between them.</li>
                     <li class="unit">Solar Core</li>
                     <li>Twilight Council unlocks both Solar Efficiency upgrade level 2 and 3.</li>
                     <li> Solar Efficiency level 1 cost: 200/200 → 150/150<br>Energy increase per tick unaffected (+2)
                     </li>
                     <li> Solar Efficiency level 2 cost: 250/250 → 225/225<br>Energy increase per tick: +4 → +5</li>
                     <li> Solar Efficiency level 3 cost unaffected (300/300)<br>Energy increase per tick: +6 → +9</li>
                     <li class="commentary">Solar Effeciency upgrades have been rebalanced to provide easier start for
                        Karax, and appropriate return value for high investement.</li>
                     <li>Player can switch to <span class="imp">Combat Chrono Wave</span>.<br>Replaces basic Chrono
                        Wave, and affects static defenses instead – increasing their attack speed, shield and energy
                        regeneration.</li>
                     <li>The switch costs no resources and takes only time. It can be reverted by switching back the
                        same way.</li>
                     <li>Both abilities share the same cooldown.</li>
                     <li class="commentary">Locking Combat Chrono Wave behind a switch provides a choice when or if to
                        get it, and prevents the inner conflict and confusion about when to use Chrono Wave to boost
                        production, and when to use it defensively.</li>
                     <li class="unit">Purifier Beam</li>
                     <li>Purifier Beam puts enemy units on fire (100 damage over 10 seconds).</li>
                     <li class="unit">Chrono Boost & Combat Chrono Wave</li>
                     <li>Combat Chrono Wave and Chrono Boost can target all defensive structures, increasing their
                        attack speed, energy and shield regeneration.</li>
                     <li>Chrono Boost: +100% attack speed, +600% shield and energy regeneration.</li>
                     <li>Combat Chrono Wave: +50% attack speed, +300% shield and energy regeneration.</li>
                     <li>If Karax is ingame, the other player can use his own Chrono Boost on any defensive structures
                        as well.</li>
                     <li class="commentary">This introduces additional depth to Karax gameplay, further reinforcing his
                        Khalai engineer fantasy, and opening unique interactions with the ally.</li>
                     <li class="unit">Combat Chronomastery</li>
                     <li>This mastery replaces "Chrono Wave Energy Regeneration" mastery.</li>
                     <li>It increases bonus of Chrono Boost and Chrono Wave for defensive structures +2% – 60%.</li>
                     <li>For example, Chrono Boost +100% → +160% attack speed; +600% → +960% bonus energy and shield
                        regeneration.</li>
                     <li class="unit">Chrono Boost Effeciency mastery</li>
                     <li>Tooltip changed to “Increases the effectiveness of Chrono Boost on production buildings” to
                        make the difference between this mastery and Combat Chronomastery clear.</li>
                     <li class="unit">Repair Beam Healing Rate mastery</li>
                     <li>Maximum bonus increased: +30% → +90%</li>
